# UCI-Console

> This project is intended to be an independent module for UCI-frontend.

## Development

- This module is integrated into the `uci` [module](https://github.com/Samagra-Development/SunbirdEd-portal/tree/release-4.0.0/src/app/client/src/app/modules/uci) in the Sunbird Portal, accessible on the `/uci` route

- The module may be served locally for development via `ng serve`

- After local changes, the module may be republished via the instructions present in `publish.sh`, and can be tested inside the portal
